# AdventOfCode 2022

## About AOC

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other. It's made and maintained by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) and other contributors.

## About this repo

This repo contains my solutions for the puzzles. I'm not trying to go for high scores or anything, I'm just trying brush up on my programming skills and have some fun. I'm using this as an opportunity to learn new languages and frameworks, though I usually just cheap out and use TypeScript anyway. I'm using this repo as a way to keep track of my progress and to share my solutions with others.
