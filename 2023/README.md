# AdventOfCode 2023

I plan on solving this year's puzzles with Ruby. I don't know what it is about Ruby, I'm not particularly good at it, but I just enjoy using it. That said, I'm not going to limit myself to just that, I'll probably use some other languages as well if I feel like it.

You can use the table below to jump to the solution for a specific day.

| Day | Language | Solution                                                                               |

## Running the solutions

I've tried to make it as easy as possible to run the solutions. All you need to do is run the following command:

```bash
$ ruby run.rb <day> [--demo]
```

Where `<day>` is the day you want to run. For example, if you want to run the solution for day 1, you'd run:

```bash
$ ruby run.rb 1
```

If you want to run it with the demo files for a specific day, you can add the `--demo` flag:

```bash
$ ruby run.rb 1 --demo
```
